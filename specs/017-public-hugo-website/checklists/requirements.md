# Specification Quality Checklist: Public Product Website, Documentation Layout, and Release Versioning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-09-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass on first iteration (2026-09-29). Static-site generator and reference-repository choices are confined to Assumptions and Dependencies for planning; functional requirements and success criteria stay outcome-focused.
- Demo mode (User Story 5, FR-015/FR-016) closes the deferred screenshot path from spec 007 using synthetic data only.
